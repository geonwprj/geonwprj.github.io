i would like to use cloudflare worker to bypass web restriction / blocking.
assume my cf worker is https://cf
if i want to access https://example.com, i will go to https://cf?url=https://example.com

if there is no value in url, go to google.com instead.

also, please help to update the link in the content to use my cloudflare worker to access as well
